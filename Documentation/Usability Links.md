# Usability Links:
This document contains the links to each of the Usability Team's semi-finalized Figma prototypes. These designs should align with the requirements and client requests, and should only be added to this file
once they are ready to be implemented. Links to working / draft docs should **not** be included on this file. If there
are any questions regarding any of these prototypes please reach out to the Usability or Requirements Team.

**Notes from RQ / US:**
   * The "More" button and menu on the navigation bar will be replaced with a "logout" button for simplicity. Profile and settings menus will not be necessary for this product.  
   * To fulfill requirements HP.1, and HP.3, the instructor's homepage must have a "Received Kudos" and "Sent Kudos" section (similar to the student homepage).
